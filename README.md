# Game AI: The Creature

## What I Did
I created a simple 2D game featuring an AI-driven creature capable of decision-making and interacting with the player in a dynamic environment.

## Why I Did This Project
I wanted to learn more about game development and AI algorithms, combining my interests in coding and interactive design to build a fun and engaging project.

## What I Accomplished
- Built an interactive 2D game using Pygame.
- Applied AI principles for decision-making based on environmental inputs.
- Improved my skills in Python programming and game design.
